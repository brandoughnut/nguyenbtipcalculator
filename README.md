Peer Review Comments: Overall your project looks pretty close to the original. I really like how you have your code and components organized as well so good job on that end!! I only have a few basic comments

    - "Can't be Zero" message looks out of place, seems like you need to either give it the same margins as "Number of People" or put the two divs in a common container

    - I like how you prevent the user from giving decimal numbers in the number of people input, if you want but it's a stylistic choice, you can do something similar in the bill input field so the user can't input bills that have more than two decimal places like $100.221 for example. 

    - Additionally if you want to you can put a limit to how big the bill can be, it might be a good idea. I noticed if I put a crazy number in there the tip amount and total will go out of the container
